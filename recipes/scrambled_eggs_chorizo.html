    <p>This chorizo and egg dish is an appetizing breakfast with spicy flavor. My Mexican husband taught me this simple and delicious recipe that serves 2 people, and I use no more than 6 eggs for both of us. You might use less or more — it doesn't matter.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
        <li>¼ cup Mexican-style chorizo, or more to taste</li>
        <li>6 large eggs</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Grease a large nonstick skillet with cooking spray; warm over medium-high heat. Cook and stir chorizo in the hot skillet until browned, about 5 minutes. </li>
        <li>Whisk together eggs and salt in a medium bowl until combined; pour over chorizo in the skillet; cook and stir until eggs are set, about 5 minutes. </li>
    </ol>
